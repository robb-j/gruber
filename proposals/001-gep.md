# 001 - Gruber Enhancement Proposals proposal

This is the a proposal for Gruber to set up a system to introduce, track, iterate & implement new features within Gruber.

## Design goals

- As simple as possible, anything complicated will not be followed
- Carefully design new Gruber APIs & functionality
- Minimal breaking changes
- Centralised to keep everything easy to find in one place
- This document should be the documentation for the proposals system

## Similar systems:

- https://github.com/tc39/proposals

## Questions:

- What should a GEP contain?
- Should there be stages to GEPs, like in TC39?
- What are the criteria for GEPs to move between stages?

## The current process

- Features are implemented or monkey-patched within projects that use Gruber. e.g.
  - Table primatives were prototyped within Make Place
  - That abstraction was also copied into the Open Lab Hub and improved / modified to work better
- If that feature is copied a few times and the implementation feels complete, it is considered as a new Gruber feature.

## Stages

0. `IDEA` — General ideas for features, this could just be a text list
1. `SKETCH` — The start of a proposal and it is assigned a number e.g. `001`
2. `COMPLETE` — The change made it into Gruber
3. `ABANDONED` — The change was not taken further

## Contents

- The history or alternate implementaions that were considered
- Any existing standards that can be used
