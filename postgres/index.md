# Postgres

This module provides an abstraction over postgres called `PostgresService` along with utilities to integrate it with other Gruber modules.

There are methods like `getPostgresMigrations`, `executePostgresMigration` and `postgresBootstrapMigration` to help platforms like Deno and Node.js implement a [Migrator](/core/#migrator).

There is also `PostgresStore` that implements the [Store](/core/#store) interface.
